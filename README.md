# NativeSpeedTest
Investigation of how fast/slow anneals change solution quality on hardware native problems

# Plots to make
* Probability of obtaining optimal solution as a function of anneal time. Requires preselected problems of a fixed size and that the problems are easily calculable beforehand.
* Best solution value for a given problem as a function of anneal time. Requires preselected problems of a fixed size.

# Problem Types
I want the problems to be hardware native. The issue is that there isn't a "generic" problem I can do... should I just stick with '''ran-k''' problems?
* Antiferromagnetic
